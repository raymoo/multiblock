Multiblock
==========
This is a library meant to help support the programming of multi-block
structures in Minetest, by providing a way to match a pattern against some
nodes.

See API.txt for usage details.

To try the demo:
 - Give yourself a multiblock:test_core
 - Place a 5x5 square of cobble
 - Put the test core on top, in the middle
 - Surround the test core with 8 identical nodes
 - Right-click the test core
